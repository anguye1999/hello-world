Starting my Github Journey

Hey Guys! 
I am currently now a sophmore in college majoring in computer science (software engineering). 
I'm still relatively new to programming, but I have been learning Java for the past couple of weeks and it seems pretty interesting.
In the future I hope to learning many programming languages and find an internship and/or a full-time job at a big corporate company. This would prove and show the hard work I did in the next couple of years but also show that anything can accomplished if I put my mind to it.
